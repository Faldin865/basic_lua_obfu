A very basic lua obfuscator.

This progam simply change the name of the variables and function that you have informed in the option.json file and put all the lines of the file in a single line.

It has been tested for LUA but can probably work on other language.

To start the program you just need to open a terminal with the repo in it and do this : 

cat NAME_OF_YOUR_FILE.lua > tmp.lua | node convert.js

It only work on Linux/Unix based machine at the moment.
